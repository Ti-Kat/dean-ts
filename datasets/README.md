# Time Series Datasets

The sample datasets in the `/ecg` subdirectories have been generated by the developers of [GutenTAG](https://github.com/HPI-Information-Systems/gutentag) for benchmarking purposes.
They represent a subset of the ECG base oscillation datasets analysed in my master thesis.

In the semi-supervised setting, the training is performed on `train_no_anomaly.csv` and the evaluation on `test.csv`.

In the unsupervised setting, both the training and subsequent evaluation is performed on `test.csv`.
