# DEAN-TS

This repository provides an implementation of the **Deep Ensemble Anomaly Detection for Time Series (DEAN-TS)** method, which I developed as part of my master thesis.
It is based on [Deep Ensemble Anomaly Detection (DEAN)](https://github.com/KDD-OpenSource/DEAN) and, as the name suggests,
transfers its concepts to the application to time series.

## Example usage

### Preparation
- Install requirements according to `requirements.txt`.

### Configuration
- Specify parameterization of DEAN-TS in `config/configuration.yaml`.

### Running
- Specify the details of the execution and apply DEAN-TS by customizing `src/main.py` and then execute it.
